## How it works

In this project, we will design and tape out an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) to obtain the in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) components of the skinâ€“electrode impedance signal, stimulated by a body signal, while using the EEG signal as the input. The ASIC consists of four fully differential operational amplifiers for implementing an active RC band-pass filter, along with four fully differential multipliers and an oscillator that generates a 1.2 kHz sinusoidal body stimulus signal.

## How to test

We expect to use AD03 board

## External hardware

Need Osccilator and a stuff
